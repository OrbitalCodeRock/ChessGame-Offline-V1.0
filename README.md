This was pretty much the first Python project I worked on. I made it as an exercise in learning the language and syntax. Currently, you can only play against yourself or with a friend offline. I'm open to the possibility of adding an AI opponent as a future project and I'm also thinking about making a version where you could host a game server. I made the game with pygame, so you will need the pygame module in order to run it.

An important thing to note while playing is that there are console prompts when promoting a pawn and when the game ends. During a console prompt, the game window may say that it is not responding, however you just have to answer the console prompt. I plan to replace these prompts with in-game menus. I would also like to mention that I was by no means a professional programmer while making this, and there may be more efficient ways of programming a chess game (Though I've improved since the project).

To play this game you need both python and pygame installed onto your computer. Information about how to install python can be found here: https://www.python.org/
To install Pygame, I reccommend using pip. Additional information can be found here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/, and here: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/. Then you have to copy this project's Chess Game folder to your machine and run the python file.
