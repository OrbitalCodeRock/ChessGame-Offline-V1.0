# ChessGame-Offline-V1.0
I recently started learning python and decided to make a chess game as my first python project. Currently, you can only play against yourself or with a friend offline. I may make an AI opponent in the future. I'm also thinking about making a version where you could host a game server. I made the game with pygame, so you will need the pygame module in order to run this game. An important thing to note while playing the game is that there are console prompts when promoting a pawn and when the game ends. During a console prompt, the game window may say that it is not responding, however you just have to answer the console prompt. I plan to replace these prompts with in-game menus. I would also like to mention that I am by no means a professional programmer and there may be more efficient ways of programming a chess game.

To play this game you need both python and pygame installed onto your computer. Information about how to install python can be found here: https://www.python.org/
To install Pygame, I reccommend using pip. Additional information can be found here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/, and here: https://pypi.org/project/pygame/. Then you have to copy this project's Chess Game folder to your machine and run the python file.
